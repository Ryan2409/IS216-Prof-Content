            Write a JavaScript code that performs the following:
            1. When this webpage loads in web browser:
                - Prompt the user to select an integer between 1 and 10 (both inclusive).
            2. Receive the user input and save into a variable.
            3. Verify that it is a valid integer between 1 and 10.
            4. If it is not a valid input:
                - Alert "Hello Hello Invalid Input!"
                - Program ends
            5. If it is a valid input:
                - Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (both inclusive) 
                    and save it into a variable called lucky_number
                - If the user input matches lucky_number:
                    - Alert "Lucky number is 7! Have a nice day!"
                      (where 7 is to be replaced with lucky_number)
                - Else
                    - Alert "Lucky number is 7! Ouch... try again next time!"
                      (where 7 is to be replaced with lucky_number)
                - Program ends
        */
